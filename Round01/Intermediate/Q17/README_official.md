# Question 17

In the word "CROCODILE," there are 9 letters. You want to create three groups, each containing three letters, while ensuring that the two 'C's must be in different groups. How many different ways can you accomplish this task?

Write a Python program to calculate the number of ways to divide the letters in
"CROCODILE" into three groups of three letters each, adhering to the condition that the two 'C's are in separate groups.

Your program should define a function called `count_ways_to_divide_word()` that
calculates and returns the number of valid ways to divide the letters.
For example, for the word "CROCODILE," the valid division could be "CRO" | "COD" | "ILE," where the 'C's are in different groups.

Your program should handle different words and lengths of words as well.

**Please write the Python code to solve this problem.**
